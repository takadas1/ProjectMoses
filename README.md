Project Moses is a java game created using the Tumblr API, Twitter API, and OpenCV Libraries. The player moves a spaceship with his or her face and the laptop's webcam. As the spaceship moves through space, words start moving down the screen. The words are pulled from posts from a specific Tumblr blog. The player can either avoid these words or type them up to destroy them. Score is accumulated by destroying the words. If the player is hit by a word, the player loses a life. In the end, the player either loses the game by losing all of his or her lives, or wins by defeating the final boss. The score is then posted to Twitter @ProjectMoses.

Tumblr API - extracting texts from tumblr blogs to use for the words
OpenCV - using the webcam and face detection for the game
Twitter API - posting the score onto the twitter feed
